This is the repo for our team project which is part of a greater course How to Make (almost) Anything. 

We decided to build a ukulele playing robot. 

This repo consists of the following folders:
 - app
   - Folder with the Rust desktop app
 - firmware
   - Folder with the arduino sketches and other stuff
